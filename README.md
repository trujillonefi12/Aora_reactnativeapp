THIS WAS  A PROJECT IN A CLASS, FOR MOBILE DEVELOPMENT, 
WE USED FRAMEWORKS LIKE REACT NATIVE TO DEVELOP THE FRONT END, AND FOR THE BACK WE 
USED APPWRITE, A VERY SIMPLE TO USE PROVIDER FOR APPS, IT WAS REALLY HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND HOW APPS ARE DESGINED IN MOBILE. 
LEARNED ABOUT NATIVEWIND, WHICH IS THE TAILWIND VERSION FOR REACT NATIVE. 
FINALLY, DISCOVERED THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO LEARN WHATEVER YOU WANT IF YOU PUT TIME, EFFORT AND LOGIC TO IT. IT EVENTUALLY WILL COME.
